Netflix Data Analysis Project

Hey there! 

This is a mini project where I explored a dataset of Netflix movies and TV shows. The goal was to practice **data cleaning, analysis, and visualization** while gaining insights into content trends on Netflix.

## What I Did

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Checked for missing values and filled them with `"Not found"` where needed (e.g., missing directors or ratings).  
   - Created a new column `title_len` to store the length of each title for further analysis.  

2. **Exploration & Insights**
   - Compared the number of **Movies vs TV Shows**, overall and per year.  
   - Identified directors with the most content.  
   - Found the **longest titles** in the dataset.  
   - Explored content by **country**.  

3. **Statistics**
   - Calculated **mean, median, min, max, and percentile** for title lengths using NumPy.  

4. **Visualizations**
   - Trend of Movies vs TV Shows per year.  
   - Ratings distribution (side by side for Movies and TV Shows).  
   - Director analysis and longest titles.  
   - Used `tight_layout()` and proper labeling for clarity.  

5. **Storytelling**
   - Added **Markdown explanations** for every chart and table to make insights clear.  
   - Focused on readability and presentation so that someone can understand the story behind the data.
